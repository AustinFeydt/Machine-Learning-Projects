WEEK 1:

Basic work for logistic regression done

Got most of the code for Naive Bayes done.  I utilized numpy's digitize functionality to quickly bin all continuous attributes, which saved a lot of time. I implemented a nested dictionary to quickly count attribute distributions for each class label
Now, all I have to do is compute the MAP, which should only take a simple loop involving careful indexing of the nested dictionary.
